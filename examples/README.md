Examples
========

Here you can find example files.
Each of the `.squashfs` files is generated by the corresponding `.sh` file.
Some files are too big so they are stored somewhere else.

Download them:

- [idle-python3.5](idle-python3.5.squashfs?raw=true) - This is the IDLE Python Shell for Python 3.5.
- [arduino-1.8.1-linux64](https://github.com/CodersOS/live-addon-maker/releases/download/arduino-1/arduino-1.8.1-linux64.squashfs) - This is the Arduino development environment.
- [flash](flash.squashfs?raw=true) - The installed `flashplugin-installer` which is required to view flash websites.
