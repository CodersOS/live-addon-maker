Examples
========

Here you can find example files.
Each of the `.squashfs` files is generated by the corresponding `.sh` file.
Some files are too big so they are stored somewhere else.

Download them:

- [idle-python3.5](z-idle-python3.5.squashfs?raw=true) - This is the IDLE Python Shell for Python 3.5.
- [arduino-1.8.1-linux64](https://github.com/CodersOS/live-addon-maker/releases/download/arduino-1/z-arduino-1.8.1-linux64.squashfs) - 
  This is the Arduino development environment.
- [flash](z-flash.squashfs?raw=true) - The installed `flashplugin-installer` which is required to view flash websites.

Generate
--------

You can generate the example files yourself.

1. Go into the [folder with the make-addon.sh](..).
2. Download an image. E.g. by running this:
   ```bash
   wget http://de.releases.ubuntu.com/yakkety/ubuntu-16.10-desktop-amd64.iso
   ```
3. Then, execute the example file:
   ```bash
   ./examples/idle-python3.5.sh
   ```

Questions
---------

**Why are they named with `z-` in the beginning?**  
Files are mounted in the alphabetic order of their names.
In order to make these files mounted on top of eachother,
they start with `z-`, so that the file system is mounted first
and then the addons.
