Examples
========

Here you can find example files.
Each of the `.squashfs` files is generated by the corresponding `.sh` file.
Some files are too big so they are stored somewhere else.

Download them:

- [idle-python3.5](idle-python3.5) - This is the IDLE Python Shell for Python 3.5

You can generate the example files yourself.

   ```
3. Then, execute the example file:
   ```bash
